6. CampusFlow — Good for institutions and workflow-focused features.
7. SkillBridge — Emphasizes bridging learners to skills and outcomes.
8. TeachLink — Good for teacher-student collaboration features.
9. ScholarDesk — Slightly formal, fits academic environments.
10. ClassBeacon — Implies notifications, presence, and activity.

Top 3 recommendations (shortlist)

- **CoursePulse** — If you want to highlight real-time analytics and activity.
- **EduXplore** — If you want a clearer educational branding.

Naming notes and checks
- Check domain availability (e.g., `coursepulse.com`, `eduxplore.com`) and social handles before finalizing.
- Prefer shorter, memorable names with available `.com`/`.dev` if you plan broad outreach.

If you want, I can:
- Run quick availability checks for the top 3 domains and suggest variants.
- Generate a small logo/color palette for the selected name.
